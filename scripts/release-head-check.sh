# release-head-check.sh — is the checked-out head the commit CI passed?
#
# Usage: release-head-check.sh <dispatched-sha>
#
# Prints `release=true` when HEAD is the dispatched commit and `release=false`
# when main has moved past it — a line release.yaml appends to GITHUB_OUTPUT. release.yaml checks out the branch head, because
# semantic-release releases only from a branch, and the head can be newer than
# the commit whose CI dispatched the run: a pull request merged while that CI
# finished. Tagging it would release a commit whose own checks had not passed.
# That happened with v4.12.0. When the head has moved, this run releases
# nothing: the newer commit's CI dispatches its own run once it passes, and
# semantic-release counts this commit's changes in that release. A
# documentation-only head dispatches nothing, so the release then waits for the
# next code change on main.
#
# An empty sha is an error, not a pass. The workflow cannot tell which commit
# CI vouched for, so it does not release.
