// is the union of three narrower contracts so that code which only meters
// (an interceptor, a handler) can depend on Meter alone, and code which only
// administers tenant ceilings can depend on TenantBudgets alone.

// Meter enforces the MaxRequests and MaxBudgetAmount caveats and keeps the
// charges ledger. Separated from Store so the issuance / revocation surface
// stays focused on identity, not runtime state.
//
// # Delegation trees
//
// A capability's counters cover its whole subtree: Bump and Charge
// apply to the capability AND to every ancestor in its delegation chain, and
// each ancestor's own ceiling — read from its stored record, not from the
// caller — must admit the increment. So an orchestrator holding 25.00 that
// delegates 2.00 to each of a hundred workers can still spend 25.00 in total,
// not 200.00. Narrowing at delegation bounds each child; this bounds the sum.
// An ancestor whose record is gone (purged after expiry) no longer bounds
// anything — its children expired with it, since a child cannot outlive its
// parent.
//
// # Copies of a Biscuit
//
// A Biscuit's holder can give a copy limits of its own (CopyCeiling), which
// arrive as Copies on BumpRequest, ChargeRequest and ReserveRequest. Each is
// counted under its revocation id, apart from its siblings, and checked
// before the capability's ceilings; the capability's counters still take
// every copy's requests and spend. A charge or reservation records the copies
// it debited, so Refund, Settle, Release and ReleaseExpired return to them
// without being handed them again. A Meter that does not count copies must
// not be paired with a verifier that sets VerifierConfig.MeterCopies.
//
// All methods are concurrency-safe. A rejected call mutates nothing, so a
// retry after rejection is safe.
