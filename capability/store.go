// Store persists capability records and revocation entries. Consumers supply
// the implementation; memstore ships an in-memory one and the reference
// deployment supplies a relational one.
//
// Records are append-mostly: capabilities aren't mutated after issuance
// except via Revoke. Revocations are checked by the verifier on every
// request; put a CachedRevocationChecker in front to keep the per-call
// cost flat.
type Store interface {
	// Insert records a capability at issuance. The persisted row holds
	// the full claim set so admin tooling can show a capability without
	// parsing the JWT, and so audit can correlate without
	// keeping every issued token.
	//
	// issuedBy is the principal that ASKED for the capability, which is not
	// c.Subject (the principal it authorises) and not c.Issuer (the service
	// that minted it). A delegated capability is requested by its parent's
	// holder; a root one by an operator. Passed as an argument rather than
	// carried on Capability because it is issuance metadata, not a claim —
	// putting it in the struct would change the token's frozen wire format.
	//
	// An id already on record returns ErrAlreadyExists and changes nothing.
	// A store that knows tenants returns ErrUnknownTenant or
	// ErrTenantDeleted for a tenant it cannot mint for.

	// Get fetches a capability record by ID. Returns ErrNotFound when
	// no row exists; callers normally treat that as ErrInvalidSignature
	// (token forgery) rather than a missing entity.
	//
	// ErrNotFound is defined in THIS package (below), not in any store
	// implementation — a third party writing its own Store must have a
	// sentinel to return without importing someone else's persistence.

	// GetRecord reads back everything Insert and Revoke wrote about a
	// capability: the capability, who issued it, and its own revocation

	// verification path; this one is for audit and admin tooling.

	// IsRevoked reports whether the capability, or any ancestor of it
	// that is still on record, is in the revocation list. Answering for
	// the chain is what makes revoking an orchestrator stop the workers it
	// spawned. Verifiers gate every request on it, so implementations
	// should make the walk a single round trip (a recursive query) and
	// bound its depth. An id not on record is not revoked.

	// duplicate revoke is a no-op. An id not on record — or not visible
	// to the caller — returns ErrNotFound and writes nothing, so a caller
	// is never told "revoked" about a capability nothing stopped.
	//
	// Every descendant stops verifying either way, because IsRevoked
	// walks the chain. CascadeChildren=true additionally writes a
	// revocation entry for each descendant, so the audit trail names
	// every capability that was stopped, not only the one an operator
	// picked.

	// its revocation entry no longer stops anything. Run by the
	// housekeeping worker so the revocation lists stay bounded.
